A fun doodling canvas


The canvas is made up of cells that can be split either vertically or horizontally. <br/>
<br/>
While creating a template of cells you can change the colors by modifying Hue, Lighntess, and Saturation.<br/>
<br/>
To split cells use <strong>A</strong> (vertical) and <strong>Z</strong> (horizontal) while clicking.<br/>
If you hold both A and Z then it will split the cell into 4 cells.<br/>
<br/>
When changing a color use <strong>B</strong> for Hue (color) <strong>L</strong> for lightness (whiteness) and <strong>S</strong> for saturation (intensity/non dullness)<br/>
<br/>
To change the colors of a cell hold <strong>H</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, or <strong>L</strong> and scroll the wheel. Using <strong>Shift</strong> while scrolling will increase the speed.<br/>
<br/>
You can combine cells as long as the combination is a rectangle. Just hole <strong>J</strong> and click the cells you want to join or drag over all the cells.<br/>
All the cells once combined will take the color of the first cell.<br/>
<br/>
To copy color from a cell to the clipboard hold <strong>C</strong> and click on any cell.<br/>
<br/>
To paste the color hold <strong>P</strong> and click any cell or drag over any cells. Hold <strong>P</strong> and click <strong>B</strong> set the color for the borders.<br/>
<br/>
You can also copy only Hue, Saturation or Light and paste only the corresponding feature by using <strong>C+H/S/L</strong> or <strong>P+H/S/L</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
Modify all cells at the same time by holding <strong>H/S/L</strong> and <strong>G</strong> then scroll.<br/>
<br/>
To remove or change the thickness of the border press <strong>B</strong><br/>
<br/>
Use Ctrl <strong>Z</strong> to revert but it only works for cell changes not color changes.<br/>
<br/>
To Erase everything and start over press E.<br/>
<br/>
