The canvas is made up of cells that can be split either vertically or horizontally. 

While creating a template of cells you can change the colors by modifying Hue, Lighntess, and Saturation.

To split cells use _A_ (vertical) and _Z_ (horizontal).
If you hold both A and Z then it will split the cell into 4 cells.

When changing a color use _H_ for Hue (color) _L_ for lightness (whiteness) and _S_ for saturation (intensity/non dullness)

To change the colors of a cell hold H, S, or L and scroll the wheel. Using _Shift_ while scrolling will increase the speed.

You can combine cells as long as the combination is a rectangle. Just hole _J_ and click the cells you want to join or drag over all the cells.
All the cells once combined will take the color of the first cell.

To copy color from a cell to the clipboard hold _C_ and click on any cell.

To paste the color hold _P_ and click any cell or drag over any cells. Hold _P_ and click _B_ set the color for the borders.

You can also copy only Hue, Saturation or Light and paste only the corresponding feature by using C+H/S/L or P+H/S/L.

Modify all cells at the same time by holding H/S/L and _G_ then scroll.

To remove or change the thickness of the border press _B_

Use Ctrl _Z_ to revert but it only works for cell changes not color changes.

To Erase everything and start over press E.
